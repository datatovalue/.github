# Data to Value

**Data Solutions for Marketing Excellence**

Helping marketing teams collect, transform and activate their marketing data to outperform their competition. Since 2009.

### Our belief: data has no intrinsic value. Activation does.

Most companies invest heavily in data collection and reporting but skip the critical step — activation. We close the loop.

**Collect → Transform → Activate → Repeat**

We're pragmatists, not purists. We'd rather duct-tape a solution together to prove it works than spend months building the perfect pipeline nobody uses. Start with 70% quality data that drives action today.

## What We Do

- **Signal Engineering** — Crafting conversion signals for ad platform algorithms
- **Marketing Data Warehouse** — 360° customer view, built for activation
- **Server-Side Tagging** — Real-time collection, enrichment & activation
- **Data Transformation** — Dataform & BigQuery at scale
- **AI & ML** — GCP, Vertex AI, BigQuery ML
